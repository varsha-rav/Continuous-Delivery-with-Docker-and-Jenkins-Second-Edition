"""Week 10 capstone (skeleton) — the release gate.

It consumes `ImagePushed` events from Kafka. For each one it should deploy that
version of the calculator, run the acceptance test, and promote the version to
`:latest` if the test passes. If the test fails, it does nothing.

The docker and HTTP mechanics are written for you (deploy, run_tests, promote,
teardown). run_tests already waits for the container to come up. YOUR job is the
consumer loop, marked with TODO: read the version, deploy it, test it, and
promote it on success.

Run it:  python release_gate.py
Feed it: run the pipeline, or `python emit_imagepushed.py <version>`
