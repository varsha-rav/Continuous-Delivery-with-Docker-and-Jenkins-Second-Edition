"""Announce that the pipeline pushed an image, so a consumer can react to it.

This runs in the pipeline's announce step (see the Jenkinsfile), inside the
kafka-python image, after the image has been built and pushed.

TODO (Exercise 10, Part 2): the consumer needs to know WHICH version to test and
promote. Add the build's version to the event below. The pipeline builds
calculator:<build number> and provides that number as the VERSION env var.
